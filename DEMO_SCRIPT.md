# Project Samarth Demo Script for Loom Video

## Introduction (0:00-0:15)
- Hi, I'm [Your Name] and this is my submission for Project Samarth
- This is an intelligent Q&A system that connects India's agricultural economy and climate data
- It sources information directly from government data portals to answer complex questions

## System Overview (0:15-0:30)
- Let me show you the architecture:
  - Frontend built with React and TailwindCSS
  - Backend with Node.js and Express.js
  - Connects to Ministry of Agriculture and IMD data sources
  - Features natural language processing and intelligent answer generation

## Live Demo (0:30-1:30)

### 1. Starting the Application (0:30-0:40)
- Start the backend server: `node server.js`
- Start the frontend: `npm run dev`
- Open browser to http://localhost:5174

### 2. First Query - Comparison (0:40-1:00)
- Type: "Compare rice production in Maharashtra and Karnataka"
- Show the structured response with data from both states
- Highlight source citations

### 3. Second Query - Trend Analysis (1:00-1:15)
- Type: "Show me rainfall trends in Pune district"
- Demonstrate trend analysis capabilities
- Point out data visualization in text format

### 4. Third Query - Policy Analysis (1:15-1:30)
- Type: "Analyze policy for promoting drought-resistant crops"
- Show how the system synthesizes data for policy recommendations
- Emphasize the source attribution

## Technical Details (1:30-1:45)
- Explain the modular architecture
- Discuss NLP implementation
- Highlight data integration approach
- Mention accuracy and traceability features

## Conclusion (1:45-2:00)
- This prototype demonstrates a functional end-to-end system
- It successfully handles complex multi-domain queries
- The system maintains data sovereignty and privacy
- Thank you for watching!
